Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"R3nVEw3QAH96","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1623264854929,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":195,"user":{"displayName":"Michael D.
